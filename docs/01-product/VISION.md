# RevOS Product Vision

> **"Jobs done, not dashboards to manage"**

## Executive Summary

**RevOS** is an AI-powered LinkedIn growth engine that transforms how coaches and small businesses generate qualified leads. By automating comment scraping, lead enrichment, and multi-channel outreach while maintaining authentic personalization, RevOS delivers what clients actually want: **qualified leads in their inbox, calls booked on their calendar**.

## Market

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target | B2B coaches, consultants, small agencies |
| Market Size | $50B+ spent on sales/marketing annually |
| SAM | 800k potential customers (coaches + founders + sales pros) |
| Business Model | SaaS ($2,000-5,000/client/month) |
| Competitive Edge | AgentKit-powered automation that learns client voice |
| Go-to-Market | Agency fulfillment model - we run campaigns for clients |

## Problem Statement

### The Current Pain

1. **LinkedIn is essential but time-consuming**
   - Need to post 3-5x/week to stay visible
   - Must engage with comments to build relationships
   - DM outreach is manual, slow, and doesn't scale

2. **Existing tools are incomplete**
   - LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Good search, terrible automation
   - Apollo.io: Great enrichment, manual outreach
   - Generic CRMs: Not built for LinkedIn-first workflows

3. **Clients don't want dashboards - they want results**
   - Too busy running their business to "learn a new tool"
   - Want leads delivered, calls booked automatically
   - Care about ROI, not metrics

## The Gap RevOS Fills

No one offers ALL of:
- LinkedIn-first automation (legally compliant via Unipile)
- AI that learns YOUR voice (cartridge system)
- Multi-channel orchestration (LinkedIn DM → Email → SMS)
- Agency fulfillment model (we do it FOR you)
- Chat-based control (AgentKit, not complex dashboards)
